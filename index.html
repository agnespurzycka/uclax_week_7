<h2>It turns out that this question is a classic for a reason. </h2>

  <h2>People have been asking it for thousands of years, and it contains more than a little history.</h2>

    <h3>The Egg Came First!</h3>
    <p>The egg comes first—when you narrow it down to chickens and the specific eggs from which they emerge. First, let’s get the scientific answer out of the way. Eggs, generally speaking, existed before chickens did. The oldest fossils of dinosaur eggs and embryos are about 190 million years old. Archaeopteryx fossils, which are the oldest generally accepted as birds, are around 150 million years old, which means that birds in general came after eggs in general. At some point, some almost-chicken creature produced an egg containing a bird whose genetic makeup, due to some small mutation, was fully chicken.</p>

    <h3>The Chicken Came First!</h3>
    <p>A few years ago a group of scientists did write about how a particular protein required for chicken egg shell formation was only found in chicken ovaries. That data was often reported as evidence that the chicken was first, but even the scientists whose study it was weren’t too convinced, with one of them calling the question “fun but pointless". An 1825 English translation of François Fénelon’s book on ancient philosophers described Aristotle’s perspective: “There could not have been a first egg to give a beginning to birds, or there would have been a first bird which gave a beginning to eggs; for a bird comes from an egg.” </p>
